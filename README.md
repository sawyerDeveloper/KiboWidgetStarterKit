# KiboWidgetStarterKit
This repo contains the files necassary to make a widget in Kibo.  You will have to copy the files into your project and then make the changes you need(adding html or models from the back-end).  The theme.json file contains a json object that needs to go into the theme.json file in the project root inside the widgets array.
